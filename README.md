## Usage

The goal of the Simon game is to repeat a series of colors and sounds that the game generates in an increasingly longer sequence. You must remember and repeat the sequence correctly for as long as possible.

Steps:
1. Understand the Colors: Familiarize yourself with the colors used in the game. Traditionally, Simon uses four colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. 
2. Start the Game: Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
3. Remember the Sequence: Simon will play a short sequence of colors and sounds. Pay close attention to the order in which the colors are displayed and the corresponding sounds. 
4. Repeat the Sequence: After Simon plays the sequence, it's your turn. Use the buttons to repeat the sequence in the exact same order that you just saw and heard. For example, if Simon played red, blue, green, you should press the corresponding buttons in that order.
5. Correct Repeat: If you correctly repeat the sequence, Simon will add another color and sound to the end of the sequence, making it one step longer.
6. Incorrect Repeat: If you make a mistake and press the wrong button or get the order wrong, the game is over.
7. Restart: You can choose to restart the game by clicking "Restart" button and try and beat your previous score.
